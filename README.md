*Project Level 3:* ***Real-World***

*This project is designed for learners who know Python fundamentals and are learning to build real-world programs.*

## Project Description

In this project, we will build a simple image gallery viewer where users can browse through images stored in a folder. The app will allow the user to select a folder from their computer and display the images of that folder:
<p align="center">
  <img src="result.gif" />
</p>
<p align="center">
  <img src="result_2.gif" />
</p>

This project is useful for building a GUI application using one of the best GUI libraries such as PyQt6, and it introduces users to managing file systems, working with images, and handling GUI events.

## Learning Benefits

- Learn how to create a basic PyQt6 GUI with interactive elements.

- Implement image navigation and display logic.

- Practice handling user input (button clicks, list selections).

## Prerequisites

**Required Libraries**:PyQt6. Install the libraries with: pip install PyQt6

**Required Files**: You need to have a folder with some images.

**IDE**: Use any IDE.

## Steps to Use `requirements.txt`:

If you want to set up the same environment on another machine or later, you can use the `requirements.txt` to install all the required dependencies.


1. **Create a New Virtual Environment**:
   If you haven't already set up a virtual environment, you can create one using the following command:

    ```bash
    python -m venv new_venv

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
  Once your virtual environment is created, activate it with the following command:

    - Windows:

    ```bash
    .\new_venv\Scripts\activate    
    ```
    - Mac/Linux:

    ```bash
    source new_venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies from requirements.txt**:
After activating your virtual environment, install the required dependencies by running:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
    This command will install all the packages listed in the requirements.txt file into your new virtual environment.
