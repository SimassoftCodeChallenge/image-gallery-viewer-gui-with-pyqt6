*Project Level 3:* ***Real-World***

*This project is designed for learners who know Python fundamentals and are learning to build real-world programs.*

## Project Description

In this project, we will build a simple image gallery viewer where users can browse through images stored in a folder. The app will allow the user to select a folder from their computer and display the images of that folder:

This project is useful for building a GUI application using one of the best GUI libraries such as PyQt6, and it introduces users to managing file systems, working with images, and handling GUI events.

## Learning Benefits

- Learn how to create a basic PyQt6 GUI with interactive elements.

- Implement image navigation and display logic.

- Practice handling user input (button clicks, list selections).

## Prerequisites

**Required Libraries**:PyQt6. Install the libraries with: pip install PyQt6

**Required Files**: You need to have a folder with some images.

**IDE**: Use any IDE.
